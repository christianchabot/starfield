COMPILE:
	make

RUN:
	make run
	or
	java Main

TEST:
	make test

Note:
	For testing it is assumed in the make file that you have set the files junit-4.13-beta.jar and hamcrest-core-1.3.jar in the java folder in your home directory. Testing uses the procedure in tutorials. The rest is done automatically with make.
